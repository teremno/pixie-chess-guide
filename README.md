Pixie Chess – Community Guide

This repository contains a community-made guide for the Pixie Chess game, currently in beta testing.

The goal of this project is to build a clear, structured, and easy-to-understand website that explains:

what pieces exist in Pixie Chess

how each piece works

what you can and cannot do with them

practical examples and gameplay tips

The guide is intended to help new and existing players understand non-standard chess mechanics, magical effects, and special rules introduced in Pixie Chess.

This is an unofficial project created by the community.
Game rules, mechanics, and piece behaviors may change during beta.
